## ❓ Why Analysr

- **Scale Beyond Regular AI Capabilities:** Traditional AI systems, like ChatGPT, struggle to handle extensive datasets (e.g., 65,000+ records) effectively. Analysr bridges this gap.
- **Seamless Motherduck, Airbyte, Groq Integration:** Thanks to Motherduck wasm client, Airbyte's API and Groq SDK.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** By combining AI with visualization tools, Analysr allows users to uncover trends, anomalies, and actionable insights quickly and intuitively.
- **User-Friendly Visualization:** Visual AI integration transforms raw data into understandable and compelling graphics, enabling better decision-making.
- **Streamlined Process**: Reduces reliance on multiple tools by offering an all-in-one platform for schema analysis and visualization.

  
## 🚶Walkthrough

1) To obtain customer review insights, sync your data to Motherduck with the schema: <code>{ "review_text": "string", "stars": "number" }</code> (More schemas support are in the future roadmap). We recommend using Airbyte due to its extensive list of sources and seamless data movement. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/415aece5-6594-4649-8d84-ec2fa1707988)

1. Hugging face dataset URL which I used - https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yelp/yelp_review_full
2. Import it to Motherduck via Airbyte (Set huggingface as source and Motherduck as destination) OR attach using my share link
```bash
-- Run this snippet to attach the database
ATTACH 'md:_share/my_db/de60469b-3a05-4d74-bf63-4c1549dd55b6';
```
3. Get a Groq token at, https://console.groq.com/keys

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite

- **Visualization**: Recharts
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Animations**: Framer Motion

- **Proxy**: Supabase edge functions
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

**Declarations:** For development, the VSCode code editor, Codeium AI helper extension, and suggestions from ChatGPT were used.

## 🔮 Future roadmap

- **Microservice for generating queries**: Currently all queries for analytics are highly coupled with code, separation of concerns and transition to microservice is required
  - [x] Create express server proxy and deploy as superbase functions
  - [ ] Separate DuckDB queries as an API call response
  - [ ] Enhance microservice with GPT Wrapper
  - [ ] Improve business insights from Groq: At present, it produces some inaccuracies due to the limitations of the open-source <code>mixtral</code> model, which lacks the necessary funding to enhance its capabilities.
